### How does the search page work?
The search uses the [Simple-Jekyll-Search Javascript Function](https://github.com/christian-fei/Simple-Jekyll-Search),
Copyright 2015-2020, Christian Fei, licensed under the MIT License.  
This function is available in the [search-script.js file](search-script.js).  
In the [search.json file](search.json), all content we want to include within the search is converted into 
key-value pairs which can then be easily read by the search script.  
In [search.html](_pages/search.html), we create the page that shows the search box and results, using the 
script and the json, and with that, the search is ready.
