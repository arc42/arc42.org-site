## arc42: Effective, lean and pragmatic architecture documentation and communication

arc42 offers a clear, simple and effective structure to document and
communicate your software system.

![image-left](/images/cabinet-sanwal-deen-300px.jpg){: .align-left}
Compare the arc42 sections to the _drawers_ of a cabinet. arc42 contains 12 such drawers, each one specialized to hold a specific kind of information about the architecture of a system.

arc42 is optimized for understandability and adequacy. It naturally guides you to explain any kind of architecture information or decision in an understandable way.

arc42 supports your style of working, your domain and your technology.
Apply it in agile, lean or formal projects - you decide.

## Documentation

* [Why arc42?](/why): What problems does arc42 solve?

* [One Minute Overview](/overview): arc42 illustrated on a single page.

* Main documentation website [**docs.arc42.org**](https://docs.arc42.org), containing many examples

## Painless documentation

arc42 users **like** the _understandability_, that mainly results from its standardized
  structure.

But what they really **love** is the _manageable effort_ it takes to create and
maintain arc42-based architecture documentation. We call it “_painless documentation_”,
using the arc42 template does not require additional effort:

*	You only describe things that your stakeholders really have to know.
*	You explain facts and issues that are necessary to understand the system or
individual design decisions.
*	You only keep track of important architecture decision that you had to
make anyhow.
