# Become Certified Professional for Software Architecture!

![](/images/arc42-learn-cpsaf.png)

We are founding members of the iSAQB association, and actively participated
in iSAQB standardization working groups ever since.

Since 2016, Gernot Starke serves as working group lead of the FLWG,
the iSAQB task force for the (Foundation Level) curriculum.

Peter and Gernot have successfully trained and coached more than 2000 (now certified)
software architecture professionals, both within inhouse and public seminars
and workshops.

Their well-known workshop "Mastering Software Architectures" attracts developers,
software designers and software architects, to coach systematic development,
communication and analysis/evaluation of software architectures.

Peter and Gernot pioneered the "_dual trainer_" mode - where two experienced
trainers are conducting training in parallel - yielding a lively, diverse
and highly motivation learning experience. They have gained their vast experience
from different backgrounds (Peter more from embedded and real-time systems,
  Gernot more from information-, web- and batch systems) - giving
  training participants many opportunities to get first-hand experience
  from these various domains.
