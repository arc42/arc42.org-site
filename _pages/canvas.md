A canvas provides a structured framework that facilitates the visualization of key elements of a system.
Based upon ideas from the famous [Business Model Canvas](https://www.strategyzer.com) we created three different canvases
to suit your current needs:

- The "Architecture Inception Canvas" is based upon Patrick Roos' original work "Software Architecture Canvas", and addresses greenfield approaches to software development. Additional info [here](https://canvas.arc42.org/architecture-inception-canvas).  
- The "Architecture Communication Canvas" helps to communicate key elements of existing software architectures. Consider it to be the _zip-version_ of conventional arc42 documentation. Additional info [here](https://canvas.arc42.org/architecture-communication-canvas).  
- Finally, the [tech stack canvas](https://techstackcanvas.io) is a new approach by [INNOQ](https://innoq.com) to have all relevant technologies of your stack documented on a single page. Document the planned technologies for a new project but also document the status quo of existing products. Highly recommended!
