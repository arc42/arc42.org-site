February 2025 marks the 20th anniversary of the pragmatic architecture template arc42. 
Reason enough to take a brief look back at its achievements and its ecosystem.

## How it all began
We (Peter and Gernot) have been involved in consulting software development projects for many years. 
Gernot focused primarily on commercial IT and information systems; Peter preferred embedded systems. 
Despite the differences in application domains, we discovered a common pattern: 
Development teams lacked adequate technical documentation for their systems. 
In addition, teams often got lost in bike-shedding: their discussions revolved almost exclusively around tooling and possible structure of such documentation, instead of creating the documentation itself. 

### Free and Open-Source
We decided to provide a suitable architecture documentation schema as an open-source product for free and ask the development teams to _focus on their content_ instead of quarrelling about structure or formats. 

That was the birth of arc42. 
In February 2005, we first published the arc42 template in German, and shortly afterwards also in English. 
The requirements schema VOLERE by Peter's colleagues Suzanne and James Robertson served as a model. 
We decided to provide a similar “drawer model” for architects and developers. 

View-based documentation was already established. 
Therefore, the 3 views “building block view, runtime view and deployment view” form the core of the template to describe the key _structural decisions_ of the solution, and the chapter “cross-cutting concepts” contains many of the _technology decisions_ of the solution.
